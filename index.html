I'm a PhD student in the department of linguistics at the <a href="https://linguistics.uconn.edu/"> University of Connecticut </a>. Before that I received my BA in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca"> University of Toronto </a>. </p>  

<p> Broadly speaking, my research focuses on syntax, its interfaces, and morphology from a comparative perspective. The overarching theme of my research is investigating whether differences observed between closely related languages and similarities between otherwise unrelated languages can be explained in terms of non-language specific features of the language faculty. In recent work, one line of inquiry I have been investigating is how cross-linguistic differences in regards to clausal architecture, can lead to  differences in syntactic locality domains (e.g. phases), and the ramifications of this point of variation across a range of phenomena. In addition to my theoretical research interests, I have an ongoing interest in field research and language documentation and have worked extensively on Uyghur (as well as Turkic more broadly). </p>  

 <p> Some topics my work has focused on include: cross-linguistic variation in the clausal middle-field, locality domains, differential object marking, ellipsis, PF movement, typology of case and agreement patterns, syntactic variation in cross-clausal dependencies (e.g. ECM).</p>
